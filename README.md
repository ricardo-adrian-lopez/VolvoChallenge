This project makes an api call to the MetaWeatherDataApi and retrieves the next day weather forecast for Gothenburg, Stockholm, Mountain View, 
London, New York, and Berlin. The application has one single activity with a navigation drawer. Clicking one of the cities in the navigation 
drawer results in an api call retrieving the next day weather forecast for that city. If I had more time, I would set up room to cache the 
network data. I would also add unit tests, and would add a button for the nav drawer on the app bar.
